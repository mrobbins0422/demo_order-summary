## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## What I learned

- Using svg images for background
- Proper element semantics
-- [HTML Semantics - Button acting as an anchor](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64443645/html-semantics-button-acting-as-an-anchor)

### Buttons or Anchors

Does the URL change?
Yes - Anchor element - jump to sections or navigate between pages.
No - Button element - perform actions on the same page (modals, pop-ups, etc.).

## Continuing research

- Semantic HTML
