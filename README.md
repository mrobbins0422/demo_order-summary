# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

![Design preview for the Order summary card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## What I learned

- Using svg images for background
- Proper element semantics for button and anchor elements

### Buttons or Anchors

Does the URL change?
- Yes - Anchor element - jump to sections or navigate between pages.
- No - Button element - perform actions on the same page (modals, pop-ups, etc.).

## Continuing research

- Semantic HTML
